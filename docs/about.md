# About

This webpage will provide technical information for the eX3 infrastructure, to facilitate usage.

Together with partners, Simula Research Laboratory has established eX3 to prepare researchers for exascale computing in Norway. The eX3 infrastructure has been funded through the [RCN program for national research infrastructures](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/270053?Kilde=FORISS&distribution=Ar&chart=bar&calcType=funding&Sprak=no&sortBy=score&sortOrder=desc&resultCount=30&offset=0&Fritekst=ex3).
In addition to the host institution Simula, the project consortium also counts the national HPC management body Sigma2, HPC research groups from the University of Tromsø, NTNU, the University of Bergen, and OsloMet, as well as the HPC technology providers Graphcore, Dolphin Interconnect Solutions, and Numascale. 

The eX3 infrastructure is not an exascale computer by itself, but it is a carefully curated ecosystem of technology components that are crucial for embracing exascale computing. It allows HPC researchers throughout Norway and their collaborators to experiment hands-on with emerging HPC technologies – hardware as well as software.
